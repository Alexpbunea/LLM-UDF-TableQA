10130280,I am a bit disappointed by this documentary film I've been wanting to watch for years as it is way less informative than I had imagined and rather cheaply made technically speaking. Otherwise it is O.K. and rather interesting.
10299920,Splendid debut. Whatever happened to Amma Asante?
8761221,One of the more harrowing viewing experiences I have been through, a touching, frightening look at poverty in South Wales. How has Amma Asante not carried on from this success?

12121358,worked on this, was not impressed....
10312442,No. No. And no. Don't waste your time on this.
9274840,Okay, so a bunch of sociopath hustlers and prostitutes do some hustling and prostituting. So what? Is this supposed to be enlightening? This film is so pretentious. It really wants to be provocative and enlightening, but it's really just superficial and e
5859477,One of the worst films ever made. (A bold statement, yes, but I simply can't live in a world where this film ISN'T one of the worst films ever made, so please indulge me.)
3459403,This movie is a mess that doesn't go about trying to answer some of the questions it poses. Too pretentious and self-satisfied for my taste, but it had potential to be something more. It almost drowns in its sense of self importance, so if that's your kin
17484910,È ok.

15996754,If this film was supposed to make me feel interested in the work of Patti Smith, then unfortunately it did the opposite.
15851268,what a woman! really inspiring and energising!\nwoohooo!!!
15832749,nice
15633930,Sebring has no interest to explain Patti Smith, to interpret her life and work or to narrate biographical events in chronological order. Instead he presents a manifold mosaic of visual fragments and music together with permanent autocommentaries. The resu
14868626,Impressionistic portrait of an icon is more interesting than most talking heads music documentaries stylistically but it's Patti Smith's presence that makes it worth your time.

14589535,Beautifully filmed portrait of an iconic artist, a film of lilting visions moving beyond the ""usual"" rock documentary format. It's doc form magically fitting it's subject,  floating cinematography transcending time, subjects wiggling into frames sparking
14586631,Her life and her music and clearly they are one and the same.
14558450,This film did not seem as if it covered 10 years, except in her beginning outline of her public life.  So I felt it somewhat simplified it.  And that is my whole impression of this doc.  Simplified or trivialized, in many ways.  Unfocused.  I don't really
14546841,There is a good amount of truly beautiful moments in the film, and they nearly make up for some of the more staged shots (think: Smith staring pensively out a window or "listlessly" singing to a cat). Worth a watch if you want to know the title character
14529999,Directed by fashion photograher Steven Sebring, Patti Smith: Dream of Life spans over eleven years of footage which gives the audience a glimpse into the singer-songwriters life. The story is told by her recent performances but for those who are unfamilia
14528053,Excellent film about Patti Smith.
14526103,Don't meet your heroes. Sometimes they're full of crap. The music was really good, though.
14486080,Unconventional musician bio-pic, a bit un-structured, but at the same time it was more interesting visually than others in this genre. I love hearing her speak and the rhythm of her voice even when reading prose. Yes, it lingered on the deaths of many of
14247813,A beautifully poetic film that captures Patti Smith's philosophical and deeply thoughtful understanding of life, art and death. For those already fans of Patti it's a series of dreamy snap shots of some precious moments. For those who don't know her histo
14246357,By turns vital, hypnotic, and elegant.
14240525,I loved this. I'm not sure how much I learnt about Patti, but it was more than that. Beautiful snap shots of her life, people from her past drifting through, her family, her poetry, all in a wonderful, melancholic black and white flow of ten years underta
14174187,All dreamy, poetic and unengaging.  Decent music though
14171384,Beautiful, simple, good edition and rhythm.

14151230,Fantastic film. What a woman. Sensitive, bold, rocking!
14138388,I like Patti for her romantic reverence for the poets and painters who quite clearly continue to inspire her so profoundly, as well as for her own creative output. This documentary captures both well.
12398379,4.5 Stars
10803157,She don't fuck much with the past but she fucks plenty with the future. She extends her hand to the ghosts that walk the streets, to the river of human potential.
10767324,This isn't the whole story of Patti Smith, just a snapshot, a sweet little visual poem. She gave the best rock n' roll show I ever went to! And I grew up during the rock n roll era, 60's/70's. Here is a taste, a live recording from WBAI 1975, :When the Hu"
10308984,heartfelt, occasionally fascinating (if a bit self-consciously ""artistic"") documentary about one of rock music's legitimate "living legends." smith is particularly illuminating on the subject of death.
10306967,I felt that I learnt so much more about her after this one. For all I know, she just put on an act - but I think Patti actually is who we see in Dream of Life. It felt real. I don't think this will appeal to non-fans, 'thou. But what do I know.
10301655,Go Deptford High. Patti use to sell the Dori Ann.
10298027,dreeeeammmm oooof loiiiiifffeeeeee
10296777,Somehow strange, I am just hearing the audio, no visuals. The screen is pitch black throughout the movie. Anybody else experiencing the same?
10287493,This is brilliant piece of observational documentary.\nA must watch for music aficionado. Infuses back the archetypal music of 70's back into popular conscience.
9029261,As a doc, it has no strenght, but as a portrait of her day-to-day life it's very appealing. Naturally, it could've been more investigative (I missed more Chelsea and Robert stuff), but watching Patti Smith, part woman, part God, talking about her life, me
6393245,amazing movie...something that left a mark on me...
3145225,Great great movie
2321307,This film is gorgeous
804201,I was never a fan of Patti's music, but I developed some empathy on her blog, this movie just made loose some of that empathy, at some point I felt like watching some sort of Amelie, so sad, I still respect her though.
144627,Its not a bad movie, but its more of a Patti Smith portrait and less of a documentary. Fans of Patti Smith will love it, no doubt, it's an artistic approach to her life which I'm sure fans would find fitting. But for some one who doesn't know about her, y
10312948,Synopsis sound similar to ‘The Purge'...... SKETCHY!
80807,this was shot near my house, and is the follow up to a tv special.
10865786,Honestly thought this was both hilarious and entertaining. I don't necessarily recall the part of the war when the British were allied to the Nazis, but I don't know, as far as transparent propaganda goes, this is a fine, fine example.

18461893,DCP, 4k. One would have to look to Powell's and Pressburger's contemporary films or in some Sovietcolor masterpieces to find such a colorful delusion, but here intrinsically structured in German Romanticism that gave as marvels as Arnold Böcklin, Novalis
